  Hello!
  
  I am a fourth-year undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and I currently study physics and mathematics. Over the past few years, I have mostly done research in applied maths, studying computational celestial, fluid, and continuum mechanics.

    This website is a bit of everything, and I have found it a good place to deposit my research experiences, publications, CV, and notes. Although mostly academic in scope, I have included some of my other interests, because I do, after all, spend a good bit of brain power thinking of non-physics things. Feel free to click around and explore, although be warned that this entire website is still somewhat under construction, as I tend to update it infrequently on my rather limited free time.
