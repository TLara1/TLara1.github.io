  Hello!
  
  I am a fourth-year undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I am currently studying physics and applied mathematics. My research is mostly in these areas, and over the last few years I have worked in computational celestial, fluid, and continuum solid mechanics.

    This website is a bit of everything. I have found it to be a good place to dump my research experiences, publications, CV, and notes. Although mostly academic in scope, I have included some of my other interests because I do, after all, spend a good bit of brain power thinking of non-physics-y things. Feel free to click around and explore, although be warned that this entire website is still somewhat under construction, as I tend to update it infrequently on my rather limited free time. 
  
  Enjoy!
