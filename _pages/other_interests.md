<h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
I have climbed since sixth grade, focusing mostly on bouldering. I climb outside less often than I would like, though I have completed a few notable problems including:
<ul>
  <li>_God Module V11_, Horspens 40, AL</li>
  <li>_Mega Man V11_, Hospital Boulders, AL</li>
  <li>_Pocket Sands V10/11_, Hospital Boulders, AL</li>
  <li>_Golden Harvert V10_, Rocktown, GA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clarinet Playing</h2>
I have played the clarinet for 12 years, first with the Decatur High School Wind Ensemble and currently with the MIT Wind Ensemble. In high school I played with the Georgia District Honour band and more recently, I played for two years with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtU0-ALytaxlR68Tv8xZ2g">MIT Video Game Orchestra (VGO)</a>. I also occasionally play with chamber groups such as the  <a href="https://ribotones.mit.edu/">MIT Ribotones </a>.
