I have climbed for almost 10 years now, focusing mostly on bouldering. Some of my notable ascents include:

<ul>
  <li><em>God Module V11</em>, Horspens 40, AL</li>
  <li><em>Stasis V11</em>, Calico Basin, NV</li>
  <li><em>Mega Man V11</em>, Hospital Boulders, AL</li>
  <li><em>Pocket Sands V10/11</em>, Hospital Boulders, AL</li>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/200694491/candy-with-a-k-boulder-area">3 Pads and a Toddler V10 FA</a></em>, Calico Basin, NV</li>
  <li><em>Hustle and Flow V10</em>, Hospital Boulders, AL</li>
  <li><em>Golden Harvest V10</em>, Rocktown, GA</li>
</ul>

<p>I also occasionally partake in local climbing competitions. Over the last few years, I have been a finalist in these competitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rockspot Brookline Spooky Send-Off 2024 - 5th place</li>
  <li>Benchmark Climbing Battle of the Beast 2024 - 3rd place</li>
  <li>Central Rock Gym Harvard Ritual 2024 - 6th place</li>
  <li>Central Rock Gym Harvard Summer Boulder Bash 2023 - 1st place</li>
  <li>Central Rock Gym Framingham Flaming Ham 2023 - 6th place</li>
</ul>

<p>I also do a dangerously high amount of Moonboarding, having completed 497 benchmark problems. I am ranked 57th in the United States in the Moonboard rankings, a testament to my love of 40-degree crimp ladders. I also do a good amount of setting on CRG Cambridge's new spray wall, which is good fun!</p>

## Clarinet Playing

</div>

<div align="justify">
I have played the clarinet for 12 years, first with the Decatur High School Wind Ensemble and currently with the <a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-wind-ensemble">MIT Wind Ensemble</a>. In high school, I played with the Georgia District Honour band, and more recently, I played for two years with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtU0-ALytaxlR68Tv8xZ2g">MIT Video Game Orchestra (VGO)</a>. I also occasionally play with chamber groups such as the <a href="https://ribotones.mit.edu">MIT Ribotones</a>, a group of MIT students who perform in retirement homes in the Boston and Cambridge area.
</div>

<div align="justify">
    My favourite pieces include Crussel's 3rd Clarinet Concerto Op. 11, Busoni's Clarinet Concertino Op. 47, Cavallini's <em>Adagio e Tarantella</em>, Spohr's 1st Clarinet Concerto Op. 26, and Weber's Clarinet Concertino Op. 26. All pieces that I've found on IMSLP.

In the little free time I do have, I enjoy playing board games, particularly with the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~sgs/games/games.html">MIT Strategic Game Society (SGS)</a>. I mainly enjoyer heavier interactive games and my favourites include all the usual suspects: <em>Spirit Island</em>, <em>Oath</em>, <em>Caverna</em>, <em>Barrage</em>, <em>War of the Ring</em>, <em>Glomhaven</em>, <em>Clash of Cultures</em>, and of course, <em>Twilight Imperium</em>. Notably, I actually prefer the 3rd edition of <em>Twilight Imperium</em> over the fourth. A worse game perhaps, but there is a certain old-fashioned charm that I feel was polished away in TI4.
</div>
<div align="justify">
I also played a good amount of <em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em> back in high school. I was quite fond of my little plastic dinosuar army and the angry dwarf who accompanied them, although I was never too good at actually playing the game. Unfortunately, nowadays I am much less able to indulge in my miniature-painting pursuits (although rumours have it, I am becoming interested in <em>Trench Crusade</em>). 
</div>
<div align="justify">
As one may guess, I have also explored tabletop role-playing games, game-mastering <em>Dungeon World</em> and <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> campaigns for my friends over the last year. I've become quite curious about <em>Draw Steel</em> recently, though I haven't played yet.
</div>
<div align="justify">
I wish I could say I played <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, but I mostly just read articles on the CEDH meta and watch LSV force artifacts in Vintage Cube, which is always entertaining.

## MIT French House _La Maison Française_
I am currently the president of the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/lmf/www/index.html"> La Maison Française</a> (LMF) living group. We are a 40 person community dedicated to daily dinners, a clean kitchen, and various vaguely French-themed activities and events. If you are a current or incoming MIT student, I highly recommend checking us out.

## Origami
In middle and high school, I did a good amount of origami, even designing my own models. I did a few exhibitions at my high school and library, and during my freshman year I was a member of <a href="http://origamit.mit.edu/"> OrigaMIT</a>, but these days I'm afraid I have not the time. Someday, I may go back to relearn some paper folding, but for now my works remain a pleasant memory of simpler, less busy times.
