I have climbed since sixth grade, focusing mostly on bouldering. Some of my notable ascents include:

<ul>
  <li><em>God Module V11</em>, Horspens 40, AL</li>
  <li><em>Mega Man V11</em>, Hospital Boulders, AL</li>
  <li><em>Pocket Sands V10/11</em>, Hospital Boulders, AL</li>
  <li><em>Golden Harvert V10</em>, Rocktown, GA</li>
</ul>

<p>I also occasionally partake in local climbing competitions. Over the last two years, I have ended as a finalist in these competitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rockspot Brookline Spooky Send-Off 2024</li>
  <li>Benchmark Climbing Battle of the Beast 2024</li>

<h2>Clarinet Playing</h2>

I have played the clarinet for 12 years, first with the Decatur High School Wind Ensemble and currently with the MIT Wind Ensemble. In high school I played with the Georgia District Honour band and more recently, I played for two years with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtU0-ALytaxlR68Tv8xZ2g">MIT Video Game Orchestra (VGO)</a>. I also occasionally play with chamber groups such as the  <a href="https://ribotones.mit.edu/">MIT Ribotones </a>.

In the little free time I do have, I enjoy playing games, particularly with the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~sgs/games/games.html">MIT Strategic Game Society (SGS)</a>. My favourite board games include <em>Spirit Island</em>, <em>Oath</em>, <em>Caverna</em>, <em>Barrage</em>, <em>War of the Ring</em>, and of course, <em>Twilight Imperium</em>. I also played a good amount of <em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em> back in high school, although I am less able to indulge my miniature-painting desires nowadays. I have also recently begun exploring role-playing games, hosting a <em>Dungeon World</em> campaign for my friends over the last month.
