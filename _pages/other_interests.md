I have played the clarinet for 12 years, first with the Decatur High School Wind Ensemble and currently with the MIT Wind Ensemble. In high school I played with the Georgia District Honour band and more recently, I played for two years with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtU0-ALytaxlR68Tv8xZ2g">MIT Video Game Orchestra (VGO)</a>. I also occasionally play with chamber groups such as the  <a href="https://ribotones.mit.edu/">MIT Ribotones </a>.
