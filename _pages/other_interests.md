I have played the clarinet for 12 years, first with the Decatur High School Wind Ensemble and currently with the MIT Wind Ensemble. In high school, I played with the Georgia District Honour band, and more recently, I played for two years with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtU0-ALytaxlR68Tv8xZ2g">MIT Video Game Orchestra (VGO)</a>. I also occasionally play with chamber groups such as the <a href="https://ribotones.mit.edu">MIT Ribotones</a>, a group of MIT students who perform in retirement homes in the Boston and Cambridge area.

<div align="justify">
    My favourite pieces include Crussel's Third Clarinet Concerto Op. 11, Busoni's Clarinet Concertino Op. 47, Cavallini's <em>Adagio e Tarantella</em>, and Weber's Clarinet Concertino Op. 26.

In the little free time I do have, I enjoy playing games, particularly with the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~sgs/games/games.html">MIT Strategic Game Society (SGS)</a>. My favourite board games include <em>Spirit Island</em>, <em>Oath</em>, <em>Caverna</em>, <em>Barrage</em>, <em>War of the Ring</em>, and of course, <em>Twilight Imperium</em>. I also played a good amount of <em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em> back in high school, although I am less able to indulge my miniature-painting desires nowadays. I have also recently begun exploring role-playing games, hosting a <em>Dungeon World</em> campaign for my friends over the last month.
