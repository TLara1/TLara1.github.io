Over the summer of 2023, I spent the majority of my days in the Bush Applied Math Lab, under the MIT department. My work involved observing and studying "walking" droplet behaviours. Turns out, when a thin layer of oil is vibrated quickly enough, small droplets will bounce over the oil's surface, propelled by their own wave patterns in so-called "pilot-wave" dynamics.

<p>My work mostly involved running experiments with our vibrating baths and tracking the resulting droplet movement. We set-up experiments with drops free to move in circular baths and tracked their motion with a high-speed camera placed overhead. These droplets move around in occasionally interesting shapes from simple orbits to more complex patterns. We still don't fully understand the complex fluid mechanics at play in these systems, but it is speculated our little bouncing droplets may serve as quantum-mechanical analogues due to their pilot-wave properties.
