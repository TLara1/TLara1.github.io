Over the summer of 2023, I spent the majority of my days in the Bush Applied Math Lab, under the MIT department. My work involved observing and studying "walking" droplet behaviours. Turns out, when a thin layer of oil is vibrated quickly enough, small droplets will bounce over the oil's surface, propelled by their own wave patterns in so-called "pilot-wave" dynamics.
