For my class on chaotic systems, my final project involved a study of a flag flapping in a constant flow. This problem would ordinarily involve a complex fluid-structure interaction simulation, but for this problem I progressed more analytically, making simplifying assumptions to reducing the flapping flag system to a single partial differential equation.
