For strange quantum reasons, the electron in a hydrogen atom can very rarely flip spins and emit a photon at 1.4204 GHZ. These emissions are extremely rare, occuring once every $$10^7$$ or so years. Luckily, there is _lots_ of hydrogen in space, so these emissions are a staple in radio astronomy due to their prevalence and long, hard-to-distort wavelengths. 

<p> For my experimental physics class, one of my projects studied these emissions, using the radio telescope atop MIT's building 54. Using frequency shifts, I was able to work out the location and velocities of emitting sources, reconstructing a map of the Milky Way Galaxy. My results gave a good first-order approximation of the distribution of stellar clusters in the Milky Way and correctly observed our galaxy's spiral arm structure.
