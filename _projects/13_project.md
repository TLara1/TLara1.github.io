My current work is with the Dunkel Applied Math group, doing research as part of the MIT SPUR program for undergraduate study. We are interested in studying the feeding behaviours of jellyfish of different sizes using the <a href="https://ibamr.github.io/"> IBAMR </a> fluid-structure interaction library. 

<p> The idea behind our work is to find the optimal efficiency of jellyfish feeding by comparing the food intake and the power expended by jellyfish that scoop food into their mouths while swimming. We predict that jellyfish living at different scales will need to adopt distinct feeding patterns to most efficiently consume food.
